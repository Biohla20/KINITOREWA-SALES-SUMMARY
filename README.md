# KINITOREWA-SALES-SUMMARY
## Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
In this project, I am tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
I needed to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. 
The goal of this project is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
- I performed an exploration of the sales data, using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
- I used Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- I created other interesting reports...  add them later
